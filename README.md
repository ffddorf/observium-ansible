# Observium with Ansible

Ansible installation of the Observium monitoring application

## Description

This code installs the application with Ansible. It is intended to be used on a blank system.

## Requirements

A recent version of Ansible is required on the control host.

The managed node can be any Linux machine, we recommend using a blank VM with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Usage

To execute the playbook on a target node, use the following command:

```shell
ansible-playbook --inventory $HOSTNAME, -e observium_domain=$FQDN site.yml
```

Replace `$HOSTNAME` with the hostname of your machine (SSH will connect to this).

Replace `$FQDN` with the fully-qualified domain name of your installation (i.e. 'observium.yourcompany.com')

## Contribution

To try out and develop the code, use Vagrant:

```shell
vagrant up
```

This will start a VM and execute the installation on it.

This code is used for Freifunk DÃ¼sseldorf's own purposes.
